# 🚂 Locomotion

(Formerly known as Trainguy's Animation Overhaul)

Locomotion is a Minecraft: Java mod centered around giving the game's entities and blocks complex gameplay-driven animations through a real-time animation system inspired by Unreal Engine's Animation Blueprints.

> **Warning!**
> This project is still in heavy development! You are free to compile yourself and try it out, but keep in mind that there will be missing animations, placeholders, and debugging visuals that will not look correct in a normal gameplay context.

| Feature                         | Status | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:--------------------------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pose Function System            | 🟩     | Implementation of state machines, blend spaces, and montage tracks.                                                                                                                           |
| PyQT Maya Exporter              | 🟩     | Tool for exporting animations out of Maya with new format with scale support.                                                                                                                 |
| First Person Player Animations  | 🟨     | The first proper stress-test of the system.                                                                                                                                                   |
| In-game configuration           | 🟩     | Settings for tweaking individual aspects of different joint animators.                                                                                                                        |
| Block / Block Entity Animations | 🟥     | Would like to re-add support for block animations, similar to the earlier implementation with Pollen, after first person animations are far enough along.                                     |
| Third Person Player Animations  | 🟥     | Whether or not this will be included with the release version or not is TBD.                                                                                                                  |
| Back-porting                    | 🟥     | Depends on the demand, given that this mod is intended to be used on vanilla-ish versions of the game and usually people playing vanilla don't often play older versions.                     |
| Synchronised Sound              | ❌      | I don't know how the sound system works currently, or what it would take to make sounds trigger with animations without breaking other sound mods, but it's something I'm keeping in mind.    |
| Open API for Modding            | 🟥     | I would like to lock down the design of the animation systems further before considering making this an open API                                                                              |
| Entity Animations               | ❌      | Too high-scope to do on my own at this juncture, requires a large amount of animations/character rigs. Functionality will support it if I were to find somebody to help out on this.          |
| Data-Driven Joint Animators     | ❌      | Design would need to be locked down enough prior to considering this.                                                                                                                         |

## 🧵 Usage and Contribution
- Pull requests for the API, bugs, and localization are welcome, but currently I'm not accepting outward contributions for animations themselves while I'm still working on the core of the mod. I would love to make this mod a use-able API for other mod developers, so any input from others on the API design is very valuable to me!
- Do not redistribute or publish compiled versions, forks, or ports of the mod publicly to places such as Curseforge or Modrinth **without explicit written permission from me**.
  - Inclusion of the mod in publicly distributed mod packs is only allowed with written permission from me as it for now requires including the play testing JAR with the mod pack.
- You can read the license [here](https://github.com/Trainguy9512/trainguys-animation-overhaul/blob/master/LICENSE)
  - The project is under an All Rights Reserved license for the time being until I begin publishing builds on Modrinth and CurseForge.

## 🔍 FAQ

- How can I download the mod?
> Currently, the mod is not available on Modrinth or Curseforge as I'm still working towards making the project feature complete for first person animations. However, if you'd like to try playing with a pre-release playtest version, you can find the latest verions [here](https://github.com/Trainguy9512/locomotion/releases)
- What versions of the game will this mod support?
> The current development target is Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.11. An experimental NeoForge 1.21.1 target is also included; it uses legacy render hooks for first-person and third-person player animations and for chest/shulker animations. Newer render-state-only integrations and the newer debug UI remain unavailable on that older target. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition will not be supported.
>
> Build the NeoForge variants with `./gradlew chiseledBuildNeoForge`.
- What mod loaders will this mod be compatible with?
> Right now both Fabric and NeoForge are supported.
- What will the mod require as a dependency?
> For the fabric version, just Fabric API. Mod Loader and YACL are optional dependencies for both Fabric and NeoForge for the configuration interface.
- What is this mod compatible with?
> Currently there is no list of what will or will not work, but generally most cosmetic vanilla-friendly mods like Essential, 3D Skin Layers, and other cosmetic mods should work perfectly fine, along with other performance mods such as Sodium or shader mods such as Iris.
>
> Additionally, right now there are no plans to implement compatibility with heavier content mods which would have their own player interaction animations (depends on the implementation).
> 
> Resource packs that change animations like Fresh Animations should be compatible, but animations added for the same kind of thing by both this mod and a resource pack will not work together.
